    "# Setup: Multi-Terminal and Multi-Account Connection Test\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to connect to multiple, simultaneously running MetaTrader 5 terminals and their respective accounts.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- To provide a clear example of managing connections to different brokers or accounts that are running in separate terminal instances.\n",
    "- To test that the `MT5Connector` can handle different terminal paths and account sections sequentially.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Prerequisites for running this notebook:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  You must have two (or more) MT5 terminals installed.\n",
    "2.  **Both terminals must be running at the same time.**\n",
    "3.  The `config.ini` file must contain separate sections for each terminal path and each account.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Workflow:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  It connects to the first terminal (`terminal_alpha`) and logs into its corresponding account. It fetches the balance and then disconnects.\n",
    "2.  It then connects to the second terminal (`terminal_beta`) and logs into its account, fetches the balance, and disconnects.\n",
    "3.  Finally, it displays the data collected from both accounts.\n"
