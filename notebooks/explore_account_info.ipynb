    "# Explore: Account Information Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook connects to a specified MetaTrader 5 account and prints a simple, formatted summary of all available account details.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- To provide a quick and clear overview of the account's status using basic `print` functions.\n",
    "- To demonstrate direct access to the attributes of the `account_info` object returned by the MT5 API.\n",
    "- This serves as a fundamental tool for checking the state of a trading account before performing any other operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Workflow:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Setup:** Imports necessary libraries and our custom `MT5Connector`. It prepares the environment for the connection.\n",
    "2.  **Data Retrieval & Display:**\n",
    "    - It defines which terminal and account to use from the `config.ini` file.\n",
    "    - It uses a single `with` block to securely connect to the terminal and log in to the specified account.\n",
    "    - Inside the block, it directly fetches the `account_info` object.\n",
    "    - It then prints all properties from the object, grouped into logical categories for better readability.\n",
    "    - The connection is automatically and safely closed at the end of the process.\n"
