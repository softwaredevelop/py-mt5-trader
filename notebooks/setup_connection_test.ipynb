    "# Setup: Advanced Connection Test\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook performs a two-stage connection test to the MetaTrader 5 terminal.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- To verify the new `MT5Connector` logic.\n",
    "- **Stage 1: Terminal Initialization.** Checks if a technical connection can be established with a specific MT5 terminal defined in `config.ini`.\n",
    "- **Stage 2: Account Login.** On the established connection, checks if it can log in to a specific trading account.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Workflow:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Imports libraries and the refactored `MT5Connector`.\n",
    "2.  Uses a `with` block to initialize a connection to a specific terminal (e.g., `terminal_default`).\n",
    "3.  Inside the block, it attempts to log in to a specific account (e.g., `account_default_demo`).\n",
    "4.  Prints terminal and account info to confirm success.\n"
